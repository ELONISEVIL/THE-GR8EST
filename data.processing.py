Data Preprocessing Script
Create a new file named data_preprocessing.py and paste the following code:

Python

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load your dataset
def load_data(file_path):
    return pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Preprocess the data
def preprocess_data(df):
    # Example preprocessing steps
    df = df.dropna()  # Remove missing values
    X = df.drop('target', axis=1)  # Features
    y = df['target']  # Target variable

    # Split the data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    data_file = 'path/to/your/data.csv'
    df = load_data(data_file)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data(df)
    print("Data preprocessing completed.")

Explanation
Load Data: This function loads your dataset from a CSV file.
Preprocess Data: This function performs basic preprocessing steps like removing missing values, splitting the data into features and target, and standardizing the features.
Main Execution: This section demonstrates how to use the functions to preprocess your data.
Integration with GitHub Actions
Make sure this script is called in your GitHub Actions workflow. Your workflow file should already include a step to run this script:

- name: Collect and preprocess data
  run: python data_preprocessing.py

Next Steps
Train Model Script: After preprocessing, you might want to create a train_model.py script to train your AI model.
Evaluate Model Script: Create an evaluate_model.py script to evaluate the performance of your trained model.
Deploy Model Script: If you plan to deploy your model, create a deploy_model.py script to handle the deployment process.
Feel free to ask if you need help with any of these scripts or have other questions. Letâ€™s keep building something amazing together! ðŸš€
